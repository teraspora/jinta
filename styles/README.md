# JINTA - John's Incredible Note-Taking App

- **Jinta** is a web app that you can run locally in your browser of choice (preferably Chrome).   It's purpose is to allow you to make notes about things, arrange them by dragging them around the screen, edit them, save them, reload them etc..
- It is built for use on desktop machines.   At some point I may make it mobile-friendly, but don't hold your breath!   If someone wants to submit a PR to do that, I'll be happy to review it and merge it if good.
- For development purposes, the 'Random' button can be clicked to produce a bunch of random notes.

- To use it, just clone the repo and open `index.html` in your browser.
